                    <p>
                        Why pay thousands of pounds when you can learn with us on a flexible pay-as-you-go basis? At our training school, we
                        offer an affordable and convenient path to becoming a qualified driving instructor.
                        <br><br>

                                We provide a comprehensive learning app that includes all the latest DVSA questions and answers, as well as hazard
                                perception videos required for the ADI theory test. This app allows you to learn all the necessary topics, practice
                                sections you are unsure of, and take mock theory tests to prepare you thoroughly. You can study independently at no
                                cost, but we also offer training support if needed to ensure you are fully prepared.

                                <br>
                                Our in-car training is conducted in our instructor vehicles, helping you achieve the driving proficiency required to
                                pass your Part 2 test. You can also practice these skills in your own time, maintaining a high standard of driving
                                essential for your new career. Once you have passed Part 1, you can apply for Part 2. You have the option to take the
                                test in our vehicle or your own, provided it meets the test requirements.

                                To develop your instructional skills in a safe and supportive environment, we start your training with you teaching your
                                trainer. Our instructor will simulate the role of a learner driver, allowing you to build essential teaching skills from
                                the outset. Once you feel confident, you can begin instructing real students with genuine training needs. After passing
                                Part 2, you can apply for your Part 3 qualifying exam as soon as you are ready. Again, you can use either our vehicle or
                                your own for this test.
