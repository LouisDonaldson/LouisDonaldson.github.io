                standard as deemed by the instructor in order to attend and complete your training. The reason being is for your safety
                and others around you, the instructor needs to be able to communicate clearly with you in order to train you and keep
                you safe. Failure to meet this requirement at any time will result in your course will being terminated and will result
                in the loss of your entire paid fees and no refund will be made or will be possible. The instructors decision is final
                when it comes to the assessment of your communication and ability to follow instructions in English.</p>
                <h2>Licence</h2>
                <p>On the day of your training, you must hold and be in possession of a valid UK driving or provisional licence. It must be
                produced to your trainer upon registration of the course. You must also provide your National Insurance Number. This may
                be required to perform a licence check.
                <br><br>
                No other forms of licence or identification will be or are acceptable. Only the original licence is acceptable, no
                copies or paper counterparts will be accepted. It is your responsibility to bring these documents to all training
                sessions that you attend with the Partner Training School . In failing to do so, training may be terminated for that day
                and fees for that day will be lost. This may impact on your course and in your losing the entire course fees. Under no
                circumstances will we be responsible or liable to you for any such loss incurred by you.
                <br><br>

                commence. Details of how to check if your licence is valid and up to date are available on the GOV website.</p>
                <h2>Attendance</h2>
                <p>You must attend all the scheduled days of training in full. Attendance requires you to attend on time so please allow
                for traffic and transport issues. As the courses are regulated by the DVSA and have a set syllabus they cannot be
                delayed or postponed for an individual. Late attendance (arriving after the start time of your training/course) may lead
                to you missing your session and your fees being forfeited. Under no circumstances will we be responsible or liable to
                you for any such losses incurred or the forfeiture of any fees by you. You cannot join the course once it has started as

                <br><br>
                We cannot offer, nor will be responsible or liable to you in relation to, refunds or compensation for missed training
                sessions or tests. If you do not attend elements of your time-tabled training, your course may be terminated and your
                continued ability to attend cancelled with no refund. Under no circumstances will we be responsible or liable to you for
                any such loss incurred by you. Courses are sold as a whole and we cannot offer refunds for part elements not attended..

                non-refund of any fees paid by you for courses you do not attend or are late for.
                <br><br>
                It is the instructor's role to teach all students to the best of their ability but it is also the student's
                responsibility to take on the role to learn. If you decide to end your training during your course and not continue
                training as instructed this will result in the loss of your entire paid fees and no refund will be made or will be
                possible.
                <br><br>
                Illness including Covid-19 - Failure to attend a booked course due to any form of illness will be subject to our
                standard terms of booking and no exception will be provided. Cancellations due to illness made with less than 5 (five)
                full working days will result in the loss of your entire paid fees and no refund will be made or will be possible. To
                avoid doubt working days are Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm excluding Bank Holidays. Orders placed less than 5 clear
                working days ahead of the training are subject to these terms.You will not be able to cancel an order once placed (for
                any reason including illness) IF less than 5 working days ahead of the training date.</p>
                <h2>Suitable Clothing</h2>
                <p>Trainees taking part in any training courses must wear suitable clothing that offers reasonable protection. Wear layers
                that will keep you warm when it is cold and take a layer off when it is warm.
                We understand you may be new to biking and may not yet have your own motorcycle equipment. However, following the
                outbreak of Covid-19 we strongly recommend you bring your own CE approved motorcycle equipment, including helmet,
                gloves, jacket, boots and think denim jeans. If you do not yet have proper motorcycle trousers and motorcycle boots, as
                an alternative, on the day of your training, you must be wearing at least thick denim trousers with no rips or tears and
                hiking boots. Please note that MSM does not accept trainers, tracksuit bottoms, sandals or shorts as you would be at
                risk of a serious injury.
                If clothing worn is viewed as inappropriate and unsafe by the training School you may be asked to rebook the training
                course at an additional cost. Under no circumstances will we be responsible or liable to you for any such loss incurred
                by you in these circumstances.</p>
                <h2>Adult Size Bicycle</h2>
                <p>It is a basic course requirement that all riders must be able to ride an adult size bicycle confidently and safely on
                the road prior to undergoing any form of motorcycle training course. The training courses provided are not designed to
                teach basic balance and control skills and are therefore a pre-requisite to taking any form of motorcycle training. If
                at any point during a motorcycle training course, the instructor believes the skill and progress being made is not safe
                and sufficient and due to a lack of balance and control which should be practiced on an adult sized bicycle, this will
                result in the instructor terminating your training course and will result in the loss of your entire paid fees and no
                refund will be made or due.</p>
                <h2>Eye Sight Test</h2>
                <p>The DVSA has strict rules for driver and motorcycle training, and it is part of their requirements (and the UK law) that
                you meet the minimum legal eye sight requirements at all times. They have devised a simple test for this, which is to
                read a registration plate (number plate) from 20.5 metres away (with, or without glasses or corrective eyewear). Failing
                to read this will result in the instructor terminating your training course will result in the loss of your entire paid
                fees and no refund will be made or will be possible.</p>
                <h2>Legal requirements</h2>
                <p>Compulsory Basic Training ( CBT ) can only be provided by an Approved Authorised Training Body ( ATB ). All Partner
                Training Schools are DVSA approved training bodies. As such, all training courses carried out by them are governed by
                the DVSA. Further details of the accreditation and requirements which need to be met to become a DVSA approved
                motorcycle training school can be found at the GOV.UK website.</p>
                <h2>Course Agreement 1</h2>
                <p>All attendees attending training courses will be required to agree to follow the instruction and guidance of the
                appointed registered trainer for the purpose of Compulsory Basic Training. IF you fail to follow the necessary
                requirements or DO NOT respond to training will have your training course terminated. Under no circumstances will we be
                responsible or liable to you for any such loss incurred by you. If you are a complete beginner/novice in relation to
                riding a motorcycle/scooter and if your EXPECTATION is to complete your CBT in one day, then we strongly suggest you
                start with a Beginners Course (commonly known as ITM - Introduction to Motorcycling) or at least 1-2 hours of Private
                Motorcycling Lessons prior to your CBT.</p>
                <h2>Course Agreement 2</h2>
                <p>All students on CBT courses must sign a disclaimer provided by the training School before any on-road training can
                commence.
                You must confirm that you are satisfied with the training you have received so far and as a result feel sufficiently
                competent to proceed with the next element of your CBT involving a minimum of two hours riding on the public highway.
                You must be able to confirm that you feel sufficiently competent to conduct the training on the public highway in the
                weather conditions prevailing at the time and that the motorcycle/scooter that your riding is suitable for you.
                Students who are declared not be safe to continue to the on-road training will be asked to finish the course and return
                for further training. Further training will be required to be booked in and paid for, usually at a discounted rate. It
                is at the instructors sole discretion how much training is required for the Student to safely progress to on-road
                training and CBT completion.
                Failure to sign this declaration will result in the course being unable to continue as the on-road element will be
                incomplete; you will need to book more onsite training.</p>
                <h2>Course Agreement 3 - Option to do your Compulsory Basic Training on a 125cc Manual (Geared)</h2>
                <p>You have an option to do your CBT either on a manual (geared) or automatic motorbike.
                However, as a road safety organisation it is the Partner Training School's job to ensure the safety of both trainees and
                the general public. To learn to ride a manual (geared) motorcycle is no easy task; even if you are an experienced car
                driver, a motorcycle is a completely different vehicle, which in turn, requires you to perform a range of unique skills
                such as balance, throttle control, higher levels of concentration, ability to deal with the exposure to varying weather
                conditions and wind, combination of foot and hand controls, etc.
                Thus, if you are a learner, with no previous recent experience on a manual bike, and if your expectation is to complete
                your CBT on the same day, we highly recommend you to do your CBT on an automatic bike; followed by a Gear Conversion
                Course to learn to ride a manual bike.</p>
                <h2>Road Traffic Violations</h2>
                <p>If you are in control of one of a Partner Training School's motorcycles or scooters you take full responsibility for any
                violations regarding road traffic laws caused by you when riding on the public highway. Relevant details will be passed
                to the appropriate authorities if requested. You will be informed of the offence. Under no circumstances will we be
                responsible or liable to you in this regard.</p>
                <h2>Behaviour</h2>
                <p>If at any time you show an unsuitable attitude, or demonstrate unacceptable risk-taking or failure to comply with an
                instruction that endangers yourself or others on the road, the Partner Training School reserves the right to immediately
                terminate training and to forfeit all fees paid to them and paid to us. Under no circumstances will we be responsible or
                liable to you for any such loss incurred by you.
                The training School instructor as a licenced DVSA assessor has the final decision in this matter. Additional training at
                the Partner Training School's discretion will be arranged at your full expense. Under no circumstances will we be
                responsible or liable to you for any such loss incurred by you.
                Any inappropriate behaviour displayed by the client while taking part in any training course, could lead to the training
                being terminated and may also lead to relevant authorities being notified.
                Any abuse towards a Training School instructors staff or other clients will not be tolerated on any level.
                If any suspected use of alcohol or illegal substances is indicated or used on site that will endanger yourself, or
                others will result in termination of the training course with immediate effect with no refund of fees paid being
                provided.
                Under no circumstances will we be responsible or liable to you for any such loss incurred by you.
                Any illegal or inappropriate behaviour will simply not be tolerated.</p>
                <h2>Customer Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Any vehicles supplied by you for use on any training courses conducted by MSM Training School will not be covered by
                their insurance policy. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have appropriate insurance in place.
                Responsibility is with you to ensure that your vehicle is in a roadworthy condition and meets the relevant legal
                requirements. “L” plates must be clearly displayed front and rear. The vehicle must also be properly taxed. A valid MOT
                certificate must be shown to the MSM Training School trainer at the start of the course. A valid insurance cover note
                must be shown. A Vehicle Log Book (V5) must be produced. The trainer will check all relevant paperwork and check the
                motorcycle is in a safe and appropriate condition to commence your training.</p>
                <h2>Injuries</h2>
                <p>In the unlikely event of an accident, or loss or damage to your personal effects, you acknowledge and agree that neither
                us nor the Partner Training School will not be liable for nor responsible for any direct or indirect loss, damage or
                injury arising from or in connection with any such accident, loss or damage.</p>
                <h2>Bike Hire</h2>
                <p>Please note that the terms below are only applicable if you are hiring a bike from MSM Training School for purposes of

                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed penalty notice offence committed in respect of that motorcycle under part three and the relevant schedules of
                    the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 as amended by the Parking Act 1989 and that those provisions may be amended or

                    <li>Excess charge which may be incurred in respect of the motorcycle in pursuance of an order sections 45 & 46 of the
                    road traffic regulation 1984 as amended by the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 and by the Parking Act 1989, and as those
                    provisions maybe amended or replaced from time to time</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Insurance provided through MSM</h3>                
                <p>The motorcycle is at all times covered by the MSM Training School's Third Party Only insurance policy, the terms of
                which are available for inspection by the hirer at the MSM Training School training centre.
                The hirer, shall, however, remain liable for any loss or damage to the motorcycle as a result of any accident, collision
                and any act of negligence of the hirer.
                <br><br>
                The hirer also shall remain liable for any loss or damage to a third party as a result of the wilful act or negligence
                of the hirer, or any breach of the terms of the insurance policy and shall indemnify the MSM Training School from any
                third party claim, whether consequential or otherwise, which arises there from.
                Moreover, from the moment you are assigned a bike (scooter or motorcycle) by your instructor, it becomes your
                responsibility forthrightly, without the need of signing/accepting any further documentation. Thus, this agreement acts
                as a provision of a hire agreement.

                We will be and are under no circumstance liable nor responsible for the quality of training, equipment, customer
                behaviour, insurance or any other event which takes place during the motorcycle training or any loss or damage suffered
                or incurred by you.
